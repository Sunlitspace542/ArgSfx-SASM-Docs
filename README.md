## Original SASM Documentation

Also included is the original SASM documentation (`SASM.DOC`), used as a reference in the creation of this new manual. You may find it useful.

No documentation was available for ArgSfx, and all documentation concerning it specifically that is found in the new manual was reconstructed from my own findings over the years.
